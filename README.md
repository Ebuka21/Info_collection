# Project 1
This project involves creating a python script which will do the following:
- Provide a mini questionnaire which will be presented for the user to answer
- collate all answers of a each user to a file
- create an excel sheet and export file to the sheet
- sort information in file into tables

Information now put in table form can then be further analysed in excel background

Further practice: analysis of information can be done in python with the help of pandas and numpy
